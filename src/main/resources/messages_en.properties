global.info.description.gencsr= A certificate cannot be created unilaterally! As a user you can only issue a <strong>request for a certificate</strong> (a so-called CSR), for the time being! \
  This request has to be <strong>approved by an administrator</strong> in the next step.<br/> In this operation the certificate will be created and can be fetched/downloaded by the user afterwards. <br/><br/>\
  So in order to get a certificate, you first need to create a private key and the mentioned CSR (Certificate Signing Request) on your machine. \
  To make things easy, we created a script for you, that you just need to run on a commandline (requires bash and openssl). <br/><br/> \
  <strong>The script DOES NOT create a certificate!!!! Only a REQUEST for a certificate!!!!</strong> There is no use to it, other than uploading it right here. \
  And if we feel generous, we'll allot a certificate to you, according to your request.

global.info.description=The created certificate is in a specific format ("X.509"). But some applications, like most browsers, require it to be in format "PKCS#12"!<br/> \
  The certificate you've got is of type "X.509". In order to generate a cert of type "PKCS#12", you need the CA-Certificate. <a href="/intermediate-ca.cert.pem">You can download it here.</a><br/>\
  You can then generate the PKCS#12-Certificate with the following command:
global.info.description.code=openssl pkcs12 -export -out user-cert.pfx -inkey <span class="fsPathText">/path/to/user.key.pem</span> -in <span class="fsPathText">/path/to/user.crt.pem</span> \
   -certfile <span class="fsPathText">/path/to/ca.crt.pem</span>
global.info.description.script.download=The script can be downloaded here.

global.info.renewal.headline=Renew Certificate
global.info.renewal.description=On renewal, the current certificate <strong>will become invalid</strong> and a <strong>new certificate will be created</strong>! <br/> \
  So in most cases, a renewal is only reasonable, if the current certificate is about to expire. <br/><br/> \
  Think twice before requesting a renewal for one of your certificates!
global.info.renewal.warning=WARNING: The current Certificate will be revoked and a new one will be created! \n\n Are you sure to request a renewal?
